You will be given a medical case in the form of a JSON schema with information about a patient, including \"AGE\", \"GENDER\", \"MARITAL STATUS\", \"RACE\", \"BROAD DIAGNOSIS\", \"MORTALITY RISK\", \"INSURANCE\" and \"REPORT\". \"BROAD DIAGNOSIS\" contains a summarized diagnostic of the current condition of the patient. \"MORTALITY RISK\" contains an assessment of the severity of the condition in terms of how likely is for the patient to die from it, with the following possible values sorted by severity: \"LOW\", \"MODERATE\", \"HIGH\" and \"VERY HIGH\", or \"UNKOWN\" if the risk wasn't assessed. \"REPORT\" includes unstructured annotations from observations and documented medical procedures that was redacted on patient discharge. Your task is to predict if the patient will die within 30 days after discharge from the hospital given the provided patient information."
